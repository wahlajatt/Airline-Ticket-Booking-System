		<p style="font-size: 30px;padding: 5px 10px;">"Since 2004, SINE AIR has been revolutionising the travel industry. Metasearch for travel? No one was doing it. Until we did.
Today, we process over 6 billion queries across our platforms each year for travel information, helping millions of travellers around the globe make confident decisions. With every query, SINE AIR searches hundreds of travel sites to show travellers the information they need to find the right flights and holiday deals."</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;padding: 5px 10px;">"In over a decade, we've grown from a small office of 14 employees into a company of over 1,000 travel-loving teammates working across 7 international brands; SINE AIR, KAYAK, SWOODOO, checkfelix, momondo, Cheapflights, Mundi and HotelsCombined. Together, we make it easier for everyone to experience the world.
In 2013, we were acquired by Booking Holdings, the world leader in online travel."</p>
